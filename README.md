An innovative iOS application that helps users predict loan approval status based on provided information using a Boosted Gradient Tree model. This project showcases a blend of iOS development and machine learning, delivering a seamless user experience coupled with accurate predictions.

Features
User-Friendly Interface:

Input loan-related details like income, credit score, and loan amount.
Simple, intuitive design optimized for smooth navigation.
Machine Learning Integration:

Utilizes a Boosted Gradient Tree model for prediction.
Trained on a dataset of historical loan approvals to ensure high accuracy.
Integrated model file attached for reproducibility.
Real-Time Prediction:

Instant results on whether a loan is likely to be approved or not.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-predictor.git  
Open the project in Xcode.
Run the app on the simulator or a connected iOS device.
Usage
Launch the app on your iOS device.
Enter loan-related details as prompted.
Tap the Predict button to view the result.
Machine Learning Model
The Boosted Gradient Tree model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of loan approvals.
Model file: loan_approval_model.json (included in the repository).
Predictions are based on factors such as income, credit score, loan amount, and more.
Tech Stack
iOS Development:
Swift
UIKit / SwiftUI (specify based on your implementation)
CoreML for integrating the model
Machine Learning:
Boosted Gradient Tree Algorithm
Model training performed using [tool/library you used, e.g., scikit-learn or XGBoost].
Future Improvements
Additional Features:
Include detailed loan analysis and suggestions for improving approval chances.
Enhanced Model:
Train the model on a larger, more diverse dataset for better generalization.
